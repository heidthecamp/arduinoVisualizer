*****README*****

This project is meant to make an arduino into a music visualizer.
It uses the Arduino FFT, SPI, and TLC5940 (*possibly not needed) libraries. 

Arduino FTT library: http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ArduinoFFT.zip

TLC5940 library: http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/downloads/list



Both are located in /arduino-1.0.5/libraries(/FFT or /Tlc5940 respectively)

I am using:

  1 Arduino Uno

  3 TLC5940NT

  16 Common Anode RGB LED (*IMOPRTANT MUST BE COMMON ANODE!)

  ?# Wires and other assorted odd componets
