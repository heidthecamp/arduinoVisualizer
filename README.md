*****README*****

This project is meant to make an arduino into a music visualizer.
It uses the Arduino FFT library and TLC5940 libraries. 

Arduino FTT library: http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ArduinoFFT.zip

TLC5940 library: http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/downloads/list

Both are located in /arduino-1.0.5/libraries(/FFT or /Tlc5940 respectively)

I am using:
  1 Arduino Uno
  3 TLC5940NT
  16 Common Anode RGB LED (*IMOPRTANT MUST BE COMMON ANODE!)
  ?# Wires and other assorted odd componets
